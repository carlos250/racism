<h1>Little Background</h1>
<p>I was raised in a tropical country called Dominican Republic, but fun fact. I was born in the US not in my family country. I was raised by my grandma in a poor environment, what made it challenging for me was the envy of the people arround me for being American. Turn out after 10 years I came back to the US and only face to see more discrimination.</p>

<p>At school no one talk to me because I was from a different race, most of the time the teacher would pity me and send me to the back of the class becaus ethe believe I was taking space for other people. Turn out most foreigner student from other country has felt the same type of discrimination in education and their social life. </p>
