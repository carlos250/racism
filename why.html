<p>For my personal experience, I witness racism in school when student didnt wanted to talk to me. Because I was mix from a different race and my teacher send me behind the class, because she said I was taking space for other people that could understand english. Honestly in the end it took one subtitude teacher has gave me an english book for me to improve my language.</p>
